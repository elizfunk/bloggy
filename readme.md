# Welcome to Bloggy!

Bloggy is a bare bones blog project complete with a React frontend powered by Vite and a Node backend.

Once complete, I will use this code as a foundation for creating my blogs.

This project can always be improved and polished. Feedback is welcome.

## TODO List:

- Add flag on editor page to determine if article already exists (user is navigating from posts page edit button, or url already has a post with a post id in it)
- Add checkboxes for title and subtitle to show on post? Or should they automatically show?
- Add Helmet to post page when ready (or other metadata helper) and ensure that metadata shows on the page
- Set slug, created date and last updated date independently when saving post/article
- Create slug function
- Add additional needed fields to DB table
- Determine structure of individual post urls
- Ensure that cookie expires and page logs out after 24 hours or sooner
- Add unit tests with accessibility tests
- Add integration testing
- Add storybook with axe enabled for ui components
